## 📁 Projects Included

### 🔹 [Loan Prediction](./Loan%20Prediction/)
Estimate loan amounts using regression models.

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost  
- Visual evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²

---

### 🔹 [Credit Card Fraud Detection](./Credit%20Card%20Fraud/)
Classify fraudulent transactions using classification models.

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Evaluation with Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC

---

### 🔹 [Customer Segmentation](./CustomerSegmentation/)
Segment mall customers into groups using clustering (unsupervised learning).

- KMeans Clustering  
- Elbow Method for optimal clusters  
- StandardScaler for normalization  
- Visualizations:
  - 2D Scatter plots (Age vs Spending Score)
  - 3D Cluster visualization (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score)

---

### 🔹 [Movie Recommender Systems](./MovieRecommenderSystems/)
Recommendation engines built using the **MovieLens 100K dataset**.

#### Implemented Approaches:
1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** – Finds similar users and recommends movies they like.  
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** – Finds similar movies and recommends based on user’s liked items.  
3. **Matrix Factorization (Gradient Descent)** – Learns latent features for users & movies for better predictions.  
4. **Content-Based Filtering** – Uses movie genres and user profiles to recommend similar content.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn (cosine similarity)  
- Matplotlib (optional visualizations)

---

## 📦 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- xgboost  
- matplotlib, seaborn  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Large datasets like `creditcard.csv` are excluded from the repo due to GitHub’s file size limits.  
- Use `.gitignore` to manage large or sensitive files.
